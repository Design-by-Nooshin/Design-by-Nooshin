            <ul>
                <li>In this project, I designed an app for a travel planner application for planning journeys with the Randstad Rail.</li> 
                <li>Randstad Rail were rebranding themselves as Tripp3r and asked to redesign their new mobile application.</li>
                <li>This was one of the projects I did during my studies at The Hague University of applied sciences.</li>
                <li>This was a list of requirements:</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>To make everything clear for myself and do a brainstorm I started with a rough sketch (below image).</li> 
                <li>At first I tried to sketch all of the "must have"s and then proceeding to "should have"s and "could have"s. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

    <p class='title'>Low-Fi prototype</p>

    <div class='normal-text'>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>In this stage I did not pay any attention to how my app looks like in terms of icons and colors and I kept it as simple as possible.</li> 
                <li>I did the design in Adobe XD. You can see the Low-Fi prototype below:</li>
            </ul>

    <p class='title'>Low-Fi - test</p>

    <div class='normal-text'>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>I used a qualitative testing protocol in which I ask the user to perform some 
                    tasks and then I observe their behavior while doing the tasks.</li> 
                <li>I kept an eye on what they say, the way they act, whether they are confused or not. </li>
                <li>Also, I recorded their interaction with the wireframe so that later I can extract points insights it. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

    <p class='title'>Hi-Fi prototype</p>

    

    <div class='normal-text'>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlike the Low-Fi prototype, this time I payed all of my attention to the appearance of the interface or UI design.</li> 
                <li>You can try the Hi-Fi prototype below:</li>

            <ul>
                <li>To test my prototype I used desirability testing. I chose 5 artboards that I wanted to use in the test.</li> 
                <li>Then I made a Google form to perform an online test for my prototype. Here is a link to the full Google form:</li>
