    <div class='normal-text'>
        <p>
            My name is Nooshin, and I'm currently studying Communication and multimedia design (User experience design) at 
            The Hague University of Applied Sciences, Netherlands. 
            I have practical experience in different fields of design, and I am always curious to explore and learn new skills!

        <p>OK, well, here is a frequently asked question about myself! Uhem...</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
